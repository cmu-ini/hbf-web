## Evaluation & Grading

### Academic Misconduct 

[Academic integrity](#statement-on-academic-integrity) is a core tenet of AIA. Instances of academic misconduct will be penalized with a **ZERO (0)** for the assignment and an _Academic Integrity Violation Report_ will be submitted to the [CMU Office of Community Standards & Integrity](https://cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/).

Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to):

1. [Plagiarism](#plagiarism-policy) in course deliverables (project proposal, lab document, etc.)

2. Directly including the output of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) in submitted work

3. [Cheating](#cheating-policy) on team or individual assignments, including sharing answers and/or solution methods

### Late Submissions

Students who miss assignment deadlines will have **24 hours** to submit late work. Late submissions will incur a **10%** deduction. _No points are awarded after the 24-hour grace period._

### Statement on Academic Integrity

_[cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/statement-on-academic-integrity.html](https://cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/statement-on-academic-integrity.html)_

Carnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve society with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.

These statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the Carnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn with commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core interaction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity requires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university community, young people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow and foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission of the university. The university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in knowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate roles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do create issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our primary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood by all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract from our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly discussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence and trust.

All members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal and professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring knowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that prepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and maintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with representing the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for conducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, cheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus atmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity.

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Carnegie Mellon Code

_[cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/code/](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/code/)_

Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.

These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.

As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.

The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.

The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Cheating Policy

According to the [_University Policy on Academic Integrity_](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html), cheating "occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but is not limited to:

1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings.

2. Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.

3. Copying from the examination or work of another person or source.

4. Submission or use of falsified data.

5. Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.

6. Falsification of academic credentials."

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Plagiarism Policy

According to the [_University Policy on Academic Integrity_](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html), plagiarism "is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to:

1. Text, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased.

2. Graphic elements.

3. Passages of music, existing either as sound or as notation.

4. Mathematical proofs.

5. Scientific data.

6. Concepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person."

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Unauthorized Assistance Policy

According to the [_University Policy on Academic Integrity_](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html), unauthorized assistance "refers to the use of sources of support that have not been specifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the completion of academic work to be graded.  Such sources of support may include but are not limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to:

1. Collaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy statement and the course instructor(s).

2. Submission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person.

3. Supplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another student.

4. Use of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings.

5. Use of unauthorized devices.

6. Submission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the case of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses."

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Research Misconduct Policy

According to the [_University Policy For Handling Alleged Misconduct In Research_](http://www.cmu.edu/academic-integrity/research/index.html), "Carnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the university. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the university must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of research with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the allegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to have explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of misconduct in research."

The policy goes on to note that "misconduct" means:

1. fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation from accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research;
2. material failure to comply with Federal requirements for the protection of researchers, human subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or
3. failure to meet other material legal requirements governing research.

"To be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a 'material failure to comply with Federal requirements' or a 'failure to meet other material legal requirements' must be intentional or grossly negligent."

To become familiar with the expectations around the responsible conduct of research, please review the guidelines for Research Ethics published by the Office of Research Integrity and Compliance.

***This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.***

### Generative AI Policy

The default policy for this course is that use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc.) is **disallowed**. The Final Project assignment in this course _can_ permit the use of generative AI with instructor approval. If your final project is approved to use generative AI tools, their use must be appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated the whole document through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note such as "I generated this work through Chat GPT and edited the content for accuracy." Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the [guidelines established by the IEEE](https://libraryguides.vu.edu.au/ieeereferencing/generativeAI#s-lg-box-wrapper-26255475). It is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found in your work. Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy. Note that expectations for "plagiarism, cheating, and acceptable assistance" on student work may vary across your courses and instructors. Please email us if you have questions regarding what is permissible and not for this particular course.
