The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and expressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve the changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission statement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic expression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching them leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, responsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by a diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic creativity can flourish.</p> <p>These statements provide groundwork for academic integrity that includes everyone in the Carnegie Mellon community. Our common objective is to make sure that we teach and learn with commitment, consistency, honesty and fidelity. This process involves at its core interaction between young and old, novice and expert, apprentice and master. Integrity requires that we examine the context in which we do our work. In the university community, young people grow and develop their identities, which mandate that all our dealings follow and foster principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, justice and fidelity to the mission of the university. The university population is increasingly diverse, faces rapid changes in knowledge and technology that have historically produced uncertainty about the appropriate roles of individuals and professions in the larger society. Each of these facts can and do create issues that we need to be aware of and deal with if we are to successfully achieve our primary missions. When these circumstances are not fully communicated to and understood by all persons in the community, unnecessary suspicions concerning integrity may distract from our teaching and learning and taint the atmosphere on campus. When they are openly discussed and conflicts concerning them openly aired, we all proceed with greater confidence and trust.</p> <p>All members of the university community have the obligation to serve as models of personal and professional integrity, as well as models for creating, expressing and transferring knowledge. This implies that the faculty not only provide the knowledge and training that prepare students to find their productive roles in society, but also help them discover and maintain integrity in the practice of that role. Staff and administrators are charged with representing the university accurately and forthrightly. Students are responsible for conducting their learning in a similarly honest and committed fashion-by avoiding plagiarism, cheating or taking credit for work not their own-and thus contributing to a campus atmosphere which expects and supports academic integrity.</p> <p>This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/#carnegie-mellon-code","title":"Carnegie Mellon Code","text":"<p>cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/code/</p> <p>Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards of personal, ethical and moral conduct possible.</p> <p>These standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of the community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, commitments kept.</p> <p>As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the standards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply.</p> <p>The discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without a commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior knowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an academic community cannot exist.</p> <p>The commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the high respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that respect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should voluntarily withdraw from the university.</p> <p>This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/#cheating-policy","title":"Cheating Policy","text":"<p>According to the University Policy on Academic Integrity, cheating \"occurs when a student avails her/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but is not limited to:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copying from the examination or work of another person or source.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submission or use of falsified data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Falsification of academic credentials.\"</p> </li> </ol> <p>This policy applies, in all respects, to this course.</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/#plagiarism-policy","title":"Plagiarism Policy","text":"<p>According to the University Policy on Academic Integrity, plagiarism \"is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation.
